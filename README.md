BindDB
------

Convert your MySQL representation of your DNS landscape into bind-compatible Zone files.

###Why?

I was fed up manually editing my zone files.

###Why not use something like BIND-DLZ?

Large legacy deployment of named servers, no time to test a new DNS solution; easier to just automatically generate zone files.
